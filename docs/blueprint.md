# **App Name**: ChatSecure AI

## Core Features:

- User Registration & Chat Simulator: Allows users to register and interact within a simulated chat environment for demonstration purposes.
- AI-Powered Text Analysis: Analyze chat messages using a pre-trained NLP model to identify drug-related slang and suspicious text, assigning a confidence score to flagged messages. The confidence score determines the threat level.
- Suspicious Activity Logging: Automatically log suspicious chat activity including user details, message content, timestamp, and AI confidence score.
- Real-Time Alert System: Generate real-time alerts upon detection of suspicious messages, notifying the admin of potential illegal activity using an LLM to tool which information needs reporting.
- Admin Dashboard: Provides a secure admin interface to view and filter suspicious activities, review user details, and manage alerts in real time.

- Background color: Light gray (#ECEFF1) to provide a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF7043) to highlight alerts and important actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable interface.
- Use minimalist, serious icons to represent security, alerts, and data.
- Prioritize a clean, tabular layout for the admin dashboard to display information clearly and efficiently.
- Subtle transitions and animations for alerts to draw attention without being intrusive.
